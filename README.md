## Ongoing Projects
Primary ongoing projects:

* The [AntennaCalculationAutotuningTool](https://github.com/LC-Linkous/AntennaCalculationAutotuningTool "AntennaCAT") is an ongoing open-source project to make antenna design easier by automating the design, calculation, scripting, and tuning of antennas created in several common simulation software. It is designed to be compatible with Ansys HFSS, Altair Feko, Simuleon CST, COMSOL Multiphysics, and EMPIRE. This project is currently in a private repository and will be released pending publication. If you are interested in collaboration, reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-linkous)
  

* Collaborative effort forked from [Dollarhyde's](https://github.com/Dollarhyde/AntennaCalculator), the [Antenna Calculator](https://github.com/LC-Linkous/AntennaCalculator) is the internal calculator for common topologies in the AntennaCAT project. Designs are being updated as they're tested/validated.


## Machine Learning


## GUI Examples
### Realtime Graphing

* A [TK GUI example](https://github.com/LC-Linkous/Example_Matplotlib-Tkinter) of realtime plotting. Mentioned previously on an old project blog, the page will be reposted.

* A [WXPython GUI example](https://github.com/LC-Linkous/Example_wxPython-Pages) of realtime plotting. Mentioned previously on an old project blog, the page will be reposted.

### Machine Learning
* A [WXPython version](https://github.com/LC-Linkous/Example_Genetic-Algorithm-Drawing) of [Samuel Hinton's Genetic Algorithm tutorials](https://cosmiccoding.com.au/tutorials/genetic_part_one/)

### Dashboards
