## Ongoing Projects
Primary ongoing projects:

* The [AntennaCalculationAutotuningTool](https://github.com/LC-Linkous/AntennaCalculationAutotuningTool "AntennaCAT") is an ongoing open-source project to make antenna design easier by automating the design, calculation, scripting, and tuning of antennas created in several common simulation software. It is designed to be compatible with Ansys, Altair Feko, Simuleon CST, and COMSOL Multiphysics. This project is currently in a private repository and will be released when the conference papers are published.
