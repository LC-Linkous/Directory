## Ongoing Projects
Primary ongoing projects:

* The [AntennaCalculationAutotuningTool](https://github.com/LC-Linkous/AntennaCalculationAutotuningTool), "AntennaCAT", is an ongoing open-source project to make antenna design easier by automating the design, calculation, scripting, and tuning of antennas created in several common simulation software. It is designed to be compatible with Ansys HFSS, Altair Feko, Simuleon CST, COMSOL Multiphysics, and EMPIRE. This project is currently in a private repository and will be released pending publication. If you are interested in collaboration, reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauren-linkous)
  

* Collaborative effort forked from [Dollarhyde's](https://github.com/Dollarhyde/AntennaCalculator), the [Antenna Calculator](https://github.com/LC-Linkous/AntennaCalculator) is the internal calculator for common topologies in the AntennaCAT project. Designs are being updated as they're tested/validated.

## FAQs

### When will the AntennaCAT source code be public?
  Roughtly Fall 2024. The AntennaCAT project is my PhD dissertation. Related code (such as the optimizers and sample data/tutorials) are being released periodically, but the main AntennaCAT software suite will be released after my dissertation defense.


### The hyperlinks to your repos are broken.
  e.g., these: L. Linkous, (LC-Linkous) (2022) AntennaCAT (Version 3.0) [source code] https://github.com/LC-Linkous/AntennaCalculationAutotuningTool
  
  They're in IEEE format. I'm lazy and ctrl+C ctrl+V these into my references when I'm writing a paper.

  
  e.g, others.
  
  Let me know and I'll update them. Some repos have been renamed, or code moved, as project have evolved in order to keep things readable. I try my best to update all of the links, but occasionally miss one.

### Have you heard of spell check?
  Yes. Soemtiems I can even ues it.
